# Would You Rather

This is a _would you rather game_ build as a project for the Udacity React Nanodegree.
The \_DATA.js file war provided by Udacity as the starter code.

## How to get it running

- clone the repo
- install all project dependencies with `npm install`
- start the development server with `npm start`

## What it does

The game let's you log in as one of three players. Once you have chosen who you want to play as, you can:

- **answer** questions by clicking on one of two options
- **ask** questions by adding two options in the input fields
- see in **my history** what questions you have asked & what options you have chosen (with a percentage of all the players who chose the same answer as you)
- see in the **highscore** who asked and answered how many questions
- **logout** to start again as another player
